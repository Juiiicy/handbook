## What is Juiiicy?

### Juiiicy, a new way to find the right talent
We are a private community for freelance designers to refer a job or apply to one. Everyday a lot of companies sends out design inquiries. But you either never hear from designers or they are probably not available. That’s why we created Juiiicy. Juiiicy let’s a designer spread the word about your inquiry so other talented designers can apply to it. Thousands of talented creative are coming on Juiiicy everyday ready to take on a new job.

### Designer posting a job keep 7% 
We believe the best way to support and motivate a designer coming on Juiiicy to spread the word about your mission is to give him a commission. 7% of the final invoice feels to be the right amount.

### Designer taking on a job keep 87%
We believe this number to be reasonable. Without the help of designers spreading the world about your mission, you probably will have not heard about it.

### Our mission is to help you find the right talent
Jeremy, Julien and Drew are spending time making Juiiicy better everyday, answering questions from clients and designers. That's why if a client finds a designer we apply a fee of 3% to the final invoice and another 3% goes to the credit card service. We truly believe that we can turn Juiiicy into the best site for designers to find freelance work. 


## How it works? 

### Candidates 
When a designer apply to your job, he will appear under the “candidates” section. You have 3 options: Hire him, Send him a message, View his portfolio.

### Messages 
We made it possible for you to communicate with a designer. Very practical to get more information about the designer.

### Hire a designer 
Once you do find a designer that fits your needs, just click on “hire” and the job is done. 

### Payments 
We decided to handle the transactions to make sure everybody gets paid. This phase is really important to us since we need to make sure that the designer that referred you gets his commission. We require you to pay at least 50% upfront to the designer before satrting the work. The rest will be due after the job is done.
